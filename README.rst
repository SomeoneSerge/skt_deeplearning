    There is plenty of material on deep learning on the web.
    
    Generally, most of the material of the class will be based on the recent conference papers from the top conferences (which are NIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, SIGGRAPH/SIGGRAPH ASIA, ACL, EMNLP). They are also the recommended source of inspiration for the topic of your class project.
